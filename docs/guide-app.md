## Running a Python app inside an Enclave

TODO: add set up for the app

For this example youâ€™ll need an EC2 instance with support for Nitro Enclaves enabled (c5.xlarge is the cheapest qualifying instance type as of this writing) and Docker installed.  See [the Deploying on AWS](deploy-aws.md) for more details.

## Create the Policy

TODO: add policy

## Build the Enclave Image

TODO: add build command

## Run the Enclave

TODO: add run command

## Next Steps

This example walked through running a simple Python app that represented running a specific microservice or a security-centric function within an enclave. It's also possible to run an entire application in an enclave to wrap it in a higher level of security.
